				<li><strong>This academic paper examining search behavior across Social Media sites was written for a class on information structure and retrieval. </strong></li>

				<li>First, current research on how users search on Social Media sites, what they search for and how they navigate between sites is reviewd. Subsequently, a list of new needs arising from Social Media search that go beyond general web search is synthesized, and an overview of how global search engines like Google and local search engines of Social Media sites try to accommodate to these needs and how these modifications are received by users is presented. Finally, the needs that havenâ€™t been addressed yet or at least not satisfactorily, especially regarding the parallel use of several sites by a single user, are identified, and possible starting points for solutions are proposed.</li>
				
				<li>The conclusion was, that improvements benefitting global Social Media Search seem to be made by applying known problems from related disciplines like web search or by generalizing results from studies about individual sites or types of Social Media. The absence of a widely used Social Media search engine suggests that this approach is not producing satisfying results.</li>
				
				<li>Although a number of studies concerning Real-time Search and Social Search/Social Navigation exist, there is very little material about search in Social Media specifically. The same observation can be made about studies regarding Social Media Use across different sites and the relevance of Social Media portfolios. Before any legitimate suggestions for improvement on Social Media Search can be made, sufficient data about Social Media use needs to be collected.</li>
